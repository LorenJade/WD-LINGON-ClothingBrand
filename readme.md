## Overview

<!-- TODO: To be changed -->
<!-- The following are just sample -->
The repository is a website of Uniqlo, a Japanese casual wear designer and retailer well-known for its LifeWear concept, which aims to give customers premium everyday apparel. The website's objective is to present Uniqlo's clothing in an engaging and responsive manner that works on all devices (or at least those that fall within the tablet/iPad range). It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript bootstrap elements, and its main features include a multi-page, interactive website with clickable and hover buttons and visually appealing banners, images, and slideshows.

## Rules, Practices and Principles
1. Always use `WD-` in the front of the Title of the Project for the Subject followed by your custom naming.
2. Do not rename any .html files; always use `index.html` as the filename.
3. Place Files in their respective folders.
4. All file naming are in camel case.
   - Camel case is naming format where there is no white space in separation of each words, the first word is in all lower case while the succeding words first letter are in upper followed by lower cased letters.
   - ex.: buttonAnimatedStyle.css
5. Use only `External CSS`.
6. Renaming of Pages folder names are a must, and relates to what it is doing or data it holding.
7. File Structure to follow below.

```
